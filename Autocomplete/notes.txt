   Armaan Ahmed       YouTuber     He helped me understand using java's Array functions.
                                    He explained the meaning of "Construct an array matches
                                    containing n elements from terms, starting at. index i."
   Kyle Clapper       TA           He helped me with BinarySearchDeluxe. The main help was
                                    how we should use the comparator to check if i is -,+, and 0.

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Wow... It was not a fun project. I went through lots of class slides to understand and solve
   this project, but I could not find a well connection from the slides. Therefore, I went to
   YouTube to understand the concept of autocomplete and found one youtuber who went over this
   project at the Princeton University. However, I significantly learned the sorting and its
   functions. I liked some details in this project, such as creating a copy of terms to protect
   original terms, checking first and last index to get the right terms of prefix, and using
   weight so that we can have a descending order.
